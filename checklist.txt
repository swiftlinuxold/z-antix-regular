WALLPAPER

The standard Swift Linux wallpapers should be displayed in SLiM and the ROX pinboard.

ROX PINBOARD DESKTOP

Conky should display the correct edition and version number.

There should be icons for OpenOffice Writer, Calc, and Impress as well as those for the diet 
edition.

FILE ASSOCIATIONS

Make sure that clicking on .doc, .odt, .xls, .ods, .ppt, and .odp files automatically opens 
these files in OpenOffice, not Abiword or Gnumeric.
